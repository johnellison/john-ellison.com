          a(href="http://www.uncommonsolutions.com/")  Uncommon Solutions 
          |  is one of five 
          a(href="http://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/feature/Microsoft-managed-partner-designation-What-it-takes-what-its-worth") Microsoft Managed Partners
          |  in the western United States. Uncommon Solutions asked me if I had time to meet and discuss a project they called &lsquo;Cloudegy&rsquo;. 

        h3 The Problem
        p Uncommon had scheduled a series of events surrounding Mobile Device Management in the cloud and had less than a month to promote the event and to register 48 attendees within their target audience.

        h3 My Strategy

        p I suggested that rather than building a campaign to market their events, they build a community of partners dedicated to heading to the cloud together. Rather than stimulate the already competitive enterprise market, why not create a non-combative atmosphere where businesses across industries could come together? Technicians, managers, C-level executives and the like would be able to share their stories, learn from each other and make better use of their company's efforts surrounding the cloud.

        p We talked about the premise of using a content marketing strategy but there wasn't budget or time to create a minimum viable audience before the event.

        h3 The Goal
        p The goal for the project was to create a website that would craft the broader vision of Cloudegy as well as promote their upcoming events.

        h3 My Process

        h4.subheader Step 1. Discovery
        p I met with the Uncommon team a second time to more fully understand the cloud market in Denver. I was fascinated by all the nuances of the enterprise landscape. It seemed like there were a myriad of obstacles associated with running a medium-to-large sized business in the cloud. 

        h4.subheader Step 2. Ideation
        p We took to the whiteboard and started looking at the concepts and key terminology behind the brand. I wanted to have consistent messaging that represented the vision as a whole in the language of Cloudegy's audience. There was a delicate balance between creating something inspiring and being honest to the community's early beginnings.

        h4.subheader Step 3. Content Writing
        p Given the written-word played such an integral role in the representation of the vision, I started the design process by writing content. After a few iterations, we had a working body for our landing page and needed to start prototyping. We had only a few weeks until the event and needed to get participants registered as soon as possible.

        p Note:
          em I really like this content-first way of approaching UI design and front-end development. I think it is crucial to design as much as you can with close-to-finished content. Otherwise you're making dozens of assumptions about the type and quantity of content&mdash;two variables that largely effect the layout and hierarchy of the design.

        h4.subheader Step 4. Delegation
        p I sat down with one of Uncommon's developers and we quickly hashed out a 
          a(href="https://trello.com/")  Trello
          |  board of tasks. We delegated responsibilities and decided to use 
          a(href="https://slack.com/")  Slack for team communication.

        p Looking at the widespread scope of my responsibilities, I realized that I would have to make decisions about how to invest my time if we were going to get the website up in time to register participants for the events.

        p My tasks covered:
        ul
          li Brand Strategy
          li Content Writing
          li UI Design and development

        p We had less than three weeks to execute.

        h4.subheader Step 5. Prototyping
        p I thought it was important to understand the experience of Cloudegy as a whole. Rather than designing the interface of the website in an isolated context, I wanted to understand how each user was coming to the site and see their journey continued.

        p I created a low-fidelity User Journey and Experience Map to help me understand the user's different points of contact.

        img(src="images/cloudegy-user-journey.jpg", alt="")

        p Working from the User Journey and Experience Map, I quickly prototyped major components. The website needed to be mobile-first and so I began from the lowest form-factor and worked toward the highest.

        img(src="images/cloudegy-wireframe-3.jpg", alt="more wireframing in my sketchbook")

        p Mobile usability and performance were two of the most important elements of the site. The Cloudegy target audience were busy corporate employees and executives who are constantly communicating on a variety of devices across contexts and we needed an experience that fit their context and their needs.

        h4.subheader Step 5. Development
        p After Uncommon approved the component wireframes we started developing the site. Our deadline was approaching swiftly so we had to scale quickly.

        p Once the main layout was formed around the content of the site, I sketched out an initial color palette to harmonize the layout with tone of the brand.

        h4.subheader Step 6. Performance Optimization
        p Once we had a solid layout established I started removing unnecessary components of our CSS framework to make the site load faster. While we met the performance budget of load-time under two seconds, there were a few other optimizations that would have resulted in better performance.

        h3 Final Outcome
        p The Cloudegy project began as a marketing campaign. My involvement transformed the campaign into a community. The contributions I made to brand strategy, content writing, UI design and development were widespread and provided a solid foundation for the cloud community to grow.
