          span.drop-cap I
          |  was 
          em always
          |  bored in school. Since I was young I turned to life outside the classroom for my education. I built my first computer when I was 12, taught myself programming at 13, and started my first online business at 17 years old.
        p After my first semester in college, I decided to run my eCommerce business full-time and let the world be my classroom&mdash;life experience my education.
        p Everyone but my father told me what I was doing was wrong, that I should stay in school and get a degree, get a job and get a mortgage, drive a nice car and be happy&mldr;
        p But that just didn&rsquo;t look like happiness to me.
        p My passions carried me to Israel to learn Hebrew, to Egypt to help start a movement, to London to raise money and to India to design and build classrooms for children with special needs.
        h4 Then my world stopped.
        p My passion crippled into survival.  My desire&mdash;replaced by necessity.
        p I came back to the US humbled and confused&mdash;unsure of what to do with my life.
        p With a new pair of eyes I looked back at my story and tried to find meaning and purpose in all that I&rsquo;d done.
        p I saw that the web enabled me to do what I believed in and to make the world a better place through what I loved.
        p I realized that with the tools of the web, I could help other people do the same&mldr;
        p I began teaming up with passionate people who wanted to make a difference in the world.  I realized that my work is about so much more than making websites.  It&rsquo;s about understanding someone&rsquo;s story and empowering them to be who they were born to be.
        h4 The Craft of Digital Design
        p During an incredible chapter at 
          a(href="http://clearleft.com") Clearleft
          | , a top digital design agency in the UK, I worked in a multi-disciplinary team to solve complex business problems using the tools of the web. I dove deeper into the craft of digital design and discovered the key elements of a successful project. I honed my tools as a designer and realized the potential to apply what I learned towards a pressing humanitarian crisis.
        h4 Helping Refugees Prosper
        p I worked nights and weekends to start an initiative called 
          a(href="http://prosper.community") Prosper
          | &mdash;a diverse community of digital professionals working together to help refugees prosper in Europe. With a distributed team of volunteers, we built a central database of refugee crisis initiatives and began moving towards a more sustainable long-term model.
        h4 My Next Chapter
        p Having immersed myself in the digital world, I realized I was neglecting many aspects of my physical life. Surrounded by natural beauty on all sides, I remembered my life-long dream to live a simpler life in harmony with nature. My wife and I are currently on an adventure to setup a smallholding that can act as a tranquil place for people outside the city.
        p I'll continue to work as a digital designer with the smallholding as fertile ground with many fruits in the years to come. Soon I'll launch the blog that chronicles our journey. Stay posted.
