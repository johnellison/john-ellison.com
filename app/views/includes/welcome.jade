      h2 My Story
      .story-text
        p I was 
          em always
          |  bored in school. Since I was young I turned to life outside the classroom for my education. I built my first computer when I was 12, taught myself programming at 13, and started my first online business at 17 years old.
        p After my first semester in college, I decided to run my eCommerce business full-time and let the world be my classroom&mdash;life experience my education.
        p Everyone but my father told me what I was doing was wrong, that I should stay in school and get a degree, get a job and get a mortgage, drive a nice car and be happy&mldr;
        p But that just didn&rsquo;t look like happiness to me.
        p My passions carried me to Israel to learn Hebrew, to Egypt to help start a movement, to London to raise money and to India to design and build classrooms for children with special needs.
        h4 Then my world stopped.
        p My passion crippled into survival.  My desire&mdash;replaced by necessity.
        p I came back to the US humbled and confused&mdash;unsure of what to do with my life.
        p With a new pair of eyes I looked back at my story and tried to find meaning and purpose in all that I&rsquo;d done.
        p I saw that the web enabled me to do what I believed in and to make the world a better place through what I loved.
        p I realized that with the tools of the web, I could help other people do the same&mldr;
        p I began teaming up with passionate people who wanted to make a difference in the world.  I realized that my work is about so much more than making websites.  It&rsquo;s about understanding someone&rsquo;s story and empowering them to be who they were born to be.
        
      h2 The Next Chapter
      .story-text
        p In a year of freelancing, I empowered nine passionate entrepreneurs to launch their dream businesses. I learned more than I ever could have imagined along the way, and recently I decided to seek full-time employment. 

        p I realized that as an employee on the right team, I could help entrepreneurs more than I ever could alone. Working on short-term projects kindled my desire to invest my passions and my skills into a long-term mission alongside creatives who shared the same vision.

        p There is a revolution in the world of business, technology and design. Business is no longer about broadcasting the benefits of your product to every person imaginable. Business is about being human, and being human is so much more than making profits. Humans are constantly asking, "What is my purpose in life?" and I believe helping people answer that question not only enables them to live better lives but it sparks delight and happiness that spreads like wildfire.

        p After months of research I've compiled a list of companies across the world who share the same vision.
