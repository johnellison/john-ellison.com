      h2 My Story
      .story-text
        p I was 
          em always
          |  bored in school. Since I was young I turned to life outside the classroom for my education. I built my first computer when I was 12, taught myself programming at 13, and started my first online business at 17 years old.
        p After my first semester in college, I decided to run my eCommerce business full-time and let the world be my classroom&mdash;life experience my education.
        p Everyone but my father told me what I was doing was wrong, that I should stay in school and get a degree, get a job and get a mortgage, drive a nice car and be happy&mldr;
        p But that just didn&rsquo;t look like happiness to me.
        p My passions carried me to Israel to learn Hebrew, to Egypt to help start a movement, to London to raise money and to India to design and build classrooms for children with special needs.
        p
          strong Then my world stopped.
        p My passion crippled into survival.  My desire &mdash; replaced by necessity.
        p I came back to the US humbled and confused &mdash; unsure of what to do with my life.
        p With a new pair of eyes I looked back at my story and tried to find meaning and purpose in all that I&rsquo;d done.
        p I saw that the web enabled me to do what I believed in and to make the world a better place through what I loved.
        p I realized that with the tools of the web, I could help other people do the same&mldr;
        p I began teaming up with passionate people who wanted to make a difference in the world.  I realized that my work is about so much more than making websites.  It&rsquo;s about understanding someone&rsquo;s story and empowering them to be who they were born to be.
        h3 What&apos;s your story?
        p I&apos;d love to see your story come to light and hear your vision for your life.
